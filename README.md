- **Fragments Layout**: Organize your app's UI into reusable components with Fragments, enabling a modular and flexible design.
- **Koin Dependency Injection**: Employ Koin, a pragmatic lightweight dependency injection framework, to manage and simplify your app's dependency graph.
- **Retrofit Networking**: Integrate Retrofit, a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java, to seamlessly communicate with web services and APIs.
- **Kotlin Flows**: Embrace Kotlin Flows, a new asynchronous stream processing feature, to handle sequences of values with reactive programming.
- **Mockito Testing**: Ensure the reliability and correctness of your code with Mockito JUnit and Mockito Kotlin for writing comprehensive unit tests.
- **Worker Threads**: Perform background operations efficiently using Workers, a part of Android's WorkManager API, for managing deferrable work.
